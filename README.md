# What is Project Roleplay? #
Project roleplay (also known as SourceMode) is a small MTA gamemode project that is designed to show new server owners how Roleplay servers used to be. The project is an open-source based gamemode which is backed up with a MIT license (meaning you can copy, modify and so on) the original branch is here 1B0Y/project-roleplay.

# What are the features? #
The features will be pretty standard. We're not going with the whole "CnR" "Civilian life" crap. We're going back to old school basics. A list of features will be available soon.
